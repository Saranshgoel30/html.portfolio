<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! Iâ€™m currently a student at Ashoka University, majoring in Computer Science â€” a journey thatâ€™s just beginning and already teaching me how powerful code can be (even when it breaks at line 12 for no reason ðŸ« ). I love asking questions, learning by doing, and turning confusion into curiosity. Though Iâ€™m still new to programming, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world tech projects, including data cleaning for state-level education analysis, fuzzy-matching algorithms using Google Apps Script, and building dashboards in Power BI. The goal? To create things that are not only smart but also genuinely useful.

Outside the classroom, I serve as the Cultural Minister for Jazbaa â€” Ashokaâ€™s cultural ministry. With a 110-member team and 18 departments under my wing, Iâ€™ve led 70+ events (yep, from high-energy Garba Nights to dreamy Winter Balls) and introduced inclusive policies, intercollegiate reforms, and even secured our first-ever sponsors. Leadership for me isnâ€™t about the title â€” itâ€™s about making people feel like they belong, helping them thrive creatively, and making things a little more fun and a lot more memorable.

And when Iâ€™m not juggling code or campus events, youâ€™ll probably find me on the basketball court. Playing ball keeps me grounded, energized, and reminds me to enjoy the game â€” whether itâ€™s sports, tech, or life. Iâ€™m someone who loves bringing people together, building cool things (even if they start messy), and always, always learning. If you're into collaborative projects, meaningful ideas, or just need someone to hype you up mid-semester, Iâ€™m your person!
